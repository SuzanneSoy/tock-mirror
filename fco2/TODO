To-do list for FCO
------------------

Have a "compiler options" field in ParseState, which can contain things like:
- optional tracing in passes
- whether to compile out overflow/bounds checks

Need to spot when a constant expression is being compiled, and generate + as
unchecked +.

Parallel assignment should be handled by a simplification pass, not by GenerateC.
(Then things get proper names and we can write a genAssignment function that
handles different types.)
 - and then array assignment can be made to work properly.

Have a final pass that checks all the mangling has been done -- i.e. function
calls have been removed, and so on.

Multidimensional array literals won't work.

We do need to have a constant folding pass -- irritatingly -- because C won't do it.

ALT needs to detect when it's being used over timers, and calculate when the
next timeout fires.

Array indexing needs to be checked against the bounds (which'll do away with a
lot of the "_sizes unused" warnings).
