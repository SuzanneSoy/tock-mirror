To-do list for FCO
------------------

Have a "compiler options" field in ParseState, which can contain things like:
- optional tracing in passes
- whether to compile out overflow/bounds checks

Need to spot when a constant expression is being compiled, and generate + as
unchecked +.

Parallel assignment should be handled by a simplification pass, not by GenerateC.
(Then things get proper names and we can write a genAssignment function that
handles different types.)

Have a final pass that checks all the mangling has been done -- i.e. function
calls have been removed, and so on.

String conversion is broken -- it needs to escape backslashes.
