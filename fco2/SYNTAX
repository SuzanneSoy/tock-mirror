Bugs in the ordered syntax in the occam2.1 manual
-------------------------------------------------

-- Things I've worked around in Parse.hs

x[y] is ambiguous -- fixed by splitting operand into a version that permits
tables and a version that doesn't.

x ! y is ambiguous.

"SIZE cs" where cs is an array of channels isn't allowed.

<< and >> are missing from dyadic.operator.

"b = TRUE" isn't a valid expression (occ21 allows it, and it's used in cglib)
-- moved TRUE/FALSE into operand.

-- Things that Parse.hs currently implements as per the spec

PROCESSOR is permitted as a process, anywhere.
