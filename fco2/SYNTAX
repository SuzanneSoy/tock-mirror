Bugs in the ordered syntax in the occam2.1 manual
-------------------------------------------------

-- Things I've worked around in Parse.hs

"x[y]" and "x ! y" are both ambiguous unless you have an idea of what x is.

"SIZE cs" where cs is an array of channels isn't allowed.

<< and >> are missing from dyadic.operator.

"b = TRUE" isn't a valid expression (occ21 allows it, and it's used in cglib).
Moved TRUE/FALSE into operand.

AND and OR don't need brackets (i.e. "x AND y AND z" is legal). While it
doesn't say so in the manual, I don't see why the same shouldn't apply to PLUS
and TIMES.

-- Things that Parse.hs currently implements as per the spec

PROCESSOR is permitted as a process, anywhere.
