Language features supported by Tock
-----------------------------------

Everything in occam2.1, minus:
- inline VALOF
- PORTs, PLACE
- ...

KRoC's TLP interface.

INLINE PROC, although it's ignored (because it should be up to the C compiler
what gets inlined).

Intrinsics:
- ASSERT
- SQRT
- DSQRT

Simple versions of #USE and #INCLUDE that only work in a process context (i.e.
you can't #INCLUDE the body of a nested block).
