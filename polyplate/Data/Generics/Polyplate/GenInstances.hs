-- Explanation of Polyplate's instances:
--
-- Polyplate is a type-class system for automatically applying generic transformations
-- to the first instance of a specific type in a large data structure.
--
-- A set of operations is represented as a tuple list, e.g.
--
-- > (a -> m a, (b -> m b, (c -> m c, ())))
--
-- The unit type is the list terminator.
--
-- The Polyplate class takes four parameters:
--
-- * The first is the type currently being processed.
--
-- * The second is the list of operations still to be checked against the current type.
--
-- * The third is the list of operations to be applied if we end up processing
-- the current type's children.
--
-- * The fourth is the monad in which it operates, which is just passed through.
--
-- There are broadly four types of instance generated by this module:
-- 
-- * The "exact match" instance.  These are of the form:
-- 
-- > instance Monad m => PolyplateM a (a -> m a, r) ops m where
-- >   transformM (f,_) _ v = f v
-- 
-- This just applies the transformation directly, as you can see, ignoring the
-- other bits and bobs.
-- 
-- * The "process children" instance.  For a data type:
--
-- > data Foo = ConstrBar Bar | ConstrBazQuux Baz Quux
--
-- This is of the form:
-- 
-- > instance (Monad m,
-- >           PolyplateM Bar (f,ops) () m,
-- >           PolyplateM Baz (f,ops) () m,
-- >           PolyplateM Quux (f,ops) () m) =>
-- >         PolyplateM Foo () (f, ops) m where
-- >  transformM () ops (ConstrBar a0)
-- >    = do r0 <- transformM ops () a0
-- >         return (ConstrBar r0)
-- >  transformM () ops (ConstrBazQuux a0 a1)
-- >    = do r0 <- transformM ops () a0
-- >         r1 <- transformM ops () a1
-- >         return (ConstrBazQuux r0 r1)
--
-- The reason for using (f, ops) in the type-class header is to distinguish this
-- from the empty set of operations (see lower down).  The operations that are
-- to be applied on descent (the third parameter) are passed to the sub-instances
-- as the list of operations to be checked (the second parameter), with a new blank
-- list of operations to apply on descent.  The bodies of the methods just apply
-- transformM to each child of the constructor, and pull the data-type back together
-- again.
--
--
-- * The "can contain" instance.  This is of the form:
--
-- > instance (Monad m, PolyplateM t r (a -> m a, ops) m) =>
-- >         PolyplateM t (a -> m a, r) ops m where
-- >  transformM (f, rest) ops v = transformM rest (f, ops) v
--
-- Here, the type being considered, t, /can/ contain the type referred to by the
-- operation, a.  So we transfer the operation from the list we're processing onto
-- the list to apply in case of direct recursion.  Then we continue processing
-- the list of operations.
--
-- * The "cannot contain" instance.  This is of the form:
--
-- > instance (Monad m, PolyplateM t r ops m) =>
-- >         PolyplateM t (a -> m a, r) ops m where
-- >  transformM (_, rest) ops v = transformM rest ops v
--
-- This instance is based on the logic that if we have worked out that a big type
-- (like Foo) cannot contain a certain type (say, String) then by implication,
-- neither of its children can contain Strings either.  So we omit the transformation
-- of the type (in this example String) when we directly descend into Foo, by not
-- copying the transformation onto the third parameter.
--
-- The final thing we need, is a base case
-- for when both the second and third parameters are empty.  This means there are
-- no operations left to examine, but also none available for direct recursion.
-- At this point we just return the value unchanged.
